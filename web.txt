How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link?

The internet is a large system composed of many small networks interconnected through one of three things: bluetooth, wifi, or ethernet cables. These networks are made up of many computers. In order to help simplify the process of connecting these computers we connect them to a specilized computer called a router which is capable of regulating signals being sent between the communicating computers. From then on we are able to connect the routers to each other to create a network. This creates inconnectiity between small groups, but in order to reach even farther we use another specilized computer called a modem which allows us to connect these small networks to the telephone infrastructure, and through this process we are able to create what we know as the internet. 

When using the internet you will often use links provided by different webpages. These links work by utilizing hidden information associated with whatever youve clicked. Often there will be a 'event button' keeping track of activity associated with the link youve clicked. This 'event button' will notify the code that you have selected the link which will then run some sort of function, sending out a prespecified request to the browser. This information is stored within a URL (Uniform resource locator) which contains the webpage you are looking for. Your browser will breakdown the URL and utilize the DNS (domain name system) to get an IP (internet protocol) for the requested site. It will then communicate with the HTTP(S) (hypertext transfer protocol(secure)) which will allow the browser to run the code for the requested site.
