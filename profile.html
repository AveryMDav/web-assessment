<h1>About the Creator</h1>
    <h3>My name is Avery Davenport</h3>
    <section>
        <h4>Who is Avery?</h4>
        <p>I was born in Seattle, Washington in 1995. I lived there all through elementary and JR High until moving to Utah halfway through 9th grade. I have lived here ever since. I have always had a deep love of animal and the natural world. This love inspired me to pursue an education in biology, eventually settling on a degree in Biochemistry. After finishing up this program I decided I wanted a little more expertise to get a niche which led me to taking a program in programming with Devmountain!</p>

        <h4>My interests:</h4>
        <ul> 
            <li>Mountain Climbing</li>
            <li>Animals (I have 2 cats)</li>
            <li>Boarding Games</li>
            <li>Magic: The Gathering (I have a ridiculously large collection)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Career/Education Goals</h4>
        <p>I hope to integrate my love of biology with my new skills in coding! There are many avenues I could puruse with this but currently I am looking at pursuing eventually getting my graduate degree in bioinformatics. Before that I aim to work in a few coding jobs after this program to gain more in field experiance and build up a resume!</p>
